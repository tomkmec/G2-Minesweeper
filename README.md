G2-Minesweeper
==============

Tiny easter egg I have included on my last day at LMC project. 
Simple Javascript implementation of mine sweeper.

Took few hours to write and debug, so don't expect some beautiful code :)
Also, the project didn't use any useful JS library, so the easter egg is pure JS, 
tried out and working on Chrome 23 and FF 17.
